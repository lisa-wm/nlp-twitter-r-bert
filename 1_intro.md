### Technical set-up

We will do exercises in **Google Colab** to ensure everybody works under the same technical conditions.

For this, you will need a Gmail address.

When you launch a Google Colab notebook it will per default open a Python environment.
The easiest way to switch to R is to directly access https://colab.to/r.

Try for yourself and open an R notebook in Google Colab.
Download the notebook linked below and save to somewhere you are reasonably likely to find again later (you will have to download more stuff later).

Afterwards, in Google Colab, click `File` ‚è© `Upload notebook` and drag `technical_setup.ipynb` into the upload section.
If you are able to execute all code cells (by hitting the **play** button), you are good to go üëæ
