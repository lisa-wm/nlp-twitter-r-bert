## Technical set-up

We will do exercises in [**Google Colab**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI) to ensure everybody works under the same technical conditions.

Please note that you will need a gmail address for this.

When you launch a Google Colab notebook it will per default open a *Python* environment.
The easiest way to switch to *R* is to directly access [https://colab.to/r](https://colab.to/r).

You should see something like this:

In order to make sure you are operating in an *R* environment, you can check by clicking `Runtime` ‚è© `Change runtime type`, upon which the following window should open:

Try for yourself and open an empty *R* notebook in Google Colab.
Download the notebook linked below and save to somewhere you are reasonably likely to find again later (you will have to download more stuff). 

[Notebook for checking technical setup](technical_setup.ipynb)

Afterwards, in Google Colab, click `File` ‚è© `Upload notebook` and drag `technical_setup.ipynb` into the upload section.
If you are able to execute all code cells (by hitting the **play** button), you are good to go üëæ
